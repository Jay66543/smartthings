<h1>Timely Presence</h1>
Timely Presence displays the current local time and the presence of the members of the house as the background.<br>Once installed use the link to run it as a webapp on Andriod, IOS, or any desktop browser. On Andriod devices i highly recomend using "Full Screen Browser" from the Play Store to get rid of the navigation and status bars.
